# 2024election

WHY:
I believe DATA "speaks".
Numbers, data have meaning, it is for us to figure out what they mean and how they correlate with each other.

Machine Learning is becoming big, maybe it is already too big. 
We use it to predict the future. 
So I wanted to take part in "predicting" the future by using data analysis, predicting the 2024 election

STEP BY STEP:
1) Which election will be used for analysis
2) Identify sources of articles, gossips
3) Python library (BeatifulSoup for scraping articles, Tweepy for social media posts, etc)
4) Archives / datasets related to past elections could help
5) Text cleaning (standarize format), remove (HTML tag, non alphanumeric characters, stop words)
6) Exploratory Data Analysis (keyword frequency, sentimment analysis, temporal trend, etc)
7) Perform correlation analysis
8) Machine learning model
9) Backtest and predict
