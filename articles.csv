<p>The first lady’s disclosure was in a<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/first-lady-melania-trump-personal-experience-covid-19/""> statement</a> about her own experience with the coronavirus. Donald Trump announced nearly two weeks ago that both he and the first lady had tested positive.</p> 
<p>In the statement on Wednesday, the first lady said: “To our great relief he [at first] tested negative, but again, as so many parents have thought over the past several months, I couldn’t help but think, ‘What about tomorrow or the next day?’</p> 
<p>“My fear came true when he was tested again and it came up positive. Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms.”</p> 
<p>Melania Trump described her own experience with coronavirus as like “a rollercoaster of symptoms in the days after” she was diagnosed.</p> 
<p>After his diagnosis, the president was admitted to Walter Reed national military medical center for treatment, and has since returned to the White House and to the campaign trail. The first lady quarantined at the White House.</p> 
<p>President Trump was widely criticized for returning to the White House when still contagious, potentially putting staff at risk. He is behind rival Joe Biden in the polls in the run-up to next month’s presidential election.</p> 
<p>On Sunday, Trump claimed he was now “immune” to the virus. On Tuesday the White House physician said Trump had tested negative for Covid-19 and was not infectious to others.</p> 
<p>The first lady said in her statement that, in one way, she was glad “the three of us went through this at the same time, so we could take care of one another and spend time together”.</p> 
<p>She said she hoped to resume her duties as soon as she can. She added: “Along with this good news, I want people to know that I understand just how fortunate my family is to have received the kind of care that we did.”</p> 
<p>More than 216,000 people in America have died from Covid-19.</p>

books/2020/nov/21/can-american-democracy-survive-donald-trump,Can American democracy survive Donald Trump?,2020-11-21T09:00:51Z,"<p>“I WON THE ELECTION!” Donald Trump <a href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1328200072987893762"">tweeted</a> in the early hours of 16 November 2020, 10 days after he lost the election. At the same time, Atlantic magazine announced <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/why-obama-fears-for-our-democracy/617087/"">an interview with Barack Obama</a>, in which he warns that the US is “entering into an epistemological crisis” – a crisis of knowing. “If we do not have the capacity to distinguish what’s true from what’s false,” Obama explains, “by definition our democracy doesn’t work.” I saw the two assertions juxtaposed on Twitter as I was finishing writing this essay, and together they demonstrate its proposition: that American democracy is facing not merely a crisis in trust, but in knowledge itself, largely because language has become increasingly untethered from reality, as we find ourselves in a swirling maelstrom of lies, disinformation, paranoia and conspiracy theories.</p> <p>The problem is exemplified by Trump’s utterance, which bears only the most tenuous relation to reality: Trump participated in an election, giving his declaration some contextual force, but he had not won the election, rendering the claim farcical to those who reject it. The capital letters make it even funnier, a failed tyrant trying to exert mastery through typography. But it stops being funny when we acknowledge that millions of people accept this lie as a decree. Their sheer volume creates a crisis in knowing, because truth-claims largely depend on consensual agreement. This is why the debates about the US’s alarming political situation have orbited so magnetically around language itself. For months, American political and historical commentators have disputed whether the Trump administration can be properly called “fascist”, whether in refusing to concede he is trying to effect a “coup”. Are these the right words to use to describe reality? Not knowing reflects a crisis of knowledge, which derives in part from a crisis in authority.</p> <p>However, the very fact that we need to ask this question helps answer it – for lying, paranoia and conspiracy are also defining features of the totalitarian societies to which American society’s resemblance is being so hotly contested. As Federico Finchelstein maintained in his recent <em>A Brief History of Fascist Lies: </em>“As facts are presented as ‘fake news’ and ideas originating among those who deny the facts become government policy, we must remember that current talk about ‘post-truth’ has a political and intellectual lineage: the history of fascist lying.” Both George Orwell and Hannah Arendt, two of history’s most acute observers of totalitarianism, situated lying squarely at the heart of the totalitarian project. Not just the Hitlerian big lie of propaganda, but a culture of pervasive lying, what Arendt called “lying as a way of life” and “lying on principle”, systematic dishonesty that destroys the collective space of historical-factual reality. Orwell similarly insisted that lying is “integral to totalitarianism”: indeed, for Orwell, totalitarianism probably “demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth”. And as Arendt wrote in <em>The Origins of Totalitarianism</em>, both the Nazis and the Soviets created markedly paranoid societies, in which the capillary action of conspiratorial fictions did as much work as ideological infrastructure.</p>    <p>“A society becomes totalitarian,” Orwell warned in his 1946 essay “The Prevention of Literature”, “when its structure becomes flagrantly artificial: that is, when its ruling class has lost its function but succeeds in clinging to power by force or fraud.” The flagrancy is part of the point. At present, that flagrantly artificial power in the US depends on a president who refuses to concede, an administration that repudiates the results of an election that was transparently fair (as corroborated by independent international election observers), the Republican leadership complicitly silent or actively encouraging these falsehoods and surrogates who flatly lie about the election outcome. The result is that some 70% of Republican voters currently believe that Biden’s win was “rigged” – although they don’t explain how a Republican Senate was returned in this same “rigged” election. The Republican party, funded by vastly wealthy donors, has turned itself into America’s ruling class, clinging to fraudulent power by refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of its opponents, withholding the consent of the loser that is necessary for democracy to function.</p> <p>There is a simple reason for this: minority rule. As <a href=""https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/12/03/democracys-afterlife/"">Fintan O’Toole recently argued</a> in the New York Review of Books<em>: “</em>The logic is not that a permanently minority party <em>may </em>move toward authoritarianism but that it <em>must</em>. Holding power against the wishes of most citizens is an innately despotic act.” Abraham Lincoln pointed out the same thing in his first inaugural address in 1861, a month before America plunged into a civil war: “A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible. The rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.” The Republicans need to establish the rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement, or they must concede not Trump’s inevitable defeat by the majority, but their own. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/08/donald-trump-concede-legal-challenge-republicans-joe-biden-golf"">Lindsey Graham</a>, the South Carolina senator who was re-elected last week in an election whose results he disputes in self-cancelling terms, put it clearly: “If we don’t challenge and change the US election system, there will never be another Republican president elected again. President Trump should not concede.”</p> <p>This is not news to the Republican leadership. It’s why for decades they have engaged in wholesale repudiation of facts and reality, replacing evidence and history with lies and paranoia. Part of what upholds a flagrantly artificial power structure is fraudulent history: “From the totalitarian point of view,” as Orwell noted, “history is something to be created rather than learned.” We are watching the Republican party create such a fraudulent history in real time. This is not merely doctrinal, although in part it reflects a leadership coterie that has spent decades building deep partisan loyalty to itself per se, rather than to any specific policies or values it might uphold. Republicanism in America today has become its own ideology. But as Arendt observed, it was not ideological “indoctrination” that defined totalitarian lies, but rather “the incapacity or unwillingness to distinguish altogether between fact and opinion”. The same night that Trump tweeted he had won the election, Fox News host Jesse Watters told a guest he believed “that Joe Biden was installed … I can’t prove this allegation. It’s a gut feeling.” The big lie provides a substitute for unsatisfactory reality, a collective delusion that fills in the gaps between power and comprehension. It is not content with attacking individual facts, but seeks to create an alternative social fantasy that placates its believers while empowering the liars. As historian Robert Paxton observed: “Feelings propel fascism more than thought does.”</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>Conspiracy claims are the authoritarian answer to paranoia; everything is possible, but an authority remains in control</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>These fraudulent histories and distorted conspiracies rely on misinformation and “gut feeling”. In a recent interview, Tommy Tuberville, the incoming Republican senator from Alabama, declared that a Biden presidency worried him because his father, a soldier, fought in the second world war to <a href=""https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/new-alabama-senator-struggles-with-basic-wwii-history-and-says-us-fought-socialism-and-communism/ar-BB1aZVR5"">“free Europe of socialism”</a>. Meanwhile incoming Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene subscribes to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/qanon"">QAnon</a>, the far-right conspiracy theory claiming that a cabal of Satan-worshiping, paedophiliac sex-trafficking Democrats has been plotting against Trump. As the New York Times reported last year: “At Christian nationalist gatherings and strategy meetings, the Democratic party and its supporters are routinely described as ‘demonic’ and associated with ‘rulers of the darkness’.” Republicans no longer oppose Democrats politically: they are opposing them existentially.</p> <p>As Arendt understood, in its attempt to change the record, lying “is a form of action”. In this sense, lies are what the linguist JL Austin called “performative” utterances, statements that can transform social reality instead of merely describing it – but only under rigidly defined circumstances. When a judge says “guilty as charged”, the defendant’s life changes, but only if they’re both in a courtroom under the ritualised conditions of “due process”. If a judge says it at home watching a legal drama, the statement has no effect. This is why it was so absurd when Trump tweeted during the election, “I hereby claim Massachusetts” – because none of the conditions that would give that statement performative force had been met. He was just an old man shouting at clouds. But when he pronounces “I WON THE ELECTION!” he is trying to imbue his claim performatively with the symbolic authority of his office. That authority depends entirely on collective recognition. It matters that most world leaders have now “recognised” Joe Biden as America’s president-elect: society’s acceptance is what gives language performative power.</p> <p><br>•••</p> <p>In 1964 the historian Richard Hofstadter identified what he called the “paranoid style in American politics”, a perspective that shaped the stories Americans too often told themselves. Paranoia offers a master trope for interpreting “the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy” in American political narratives, from 18th-century Illuminati paranoia to the Papist conspiracies of 19th-century nativism, to the enduring anti-communist hysterias of the 20th century. Hofstadter predicted that paranoid energies would periodically be released in America when “historical catastrophes or frustrations” exacerbated the religious traditions and social structures that fostered those energies, catalysing them into “mass movements or political parties”.</p> <p>Half a century later America produced a president who embodies the paranoid style, proclaiming at every turn that investigations into his allegedly criminal activity are “witch-hunts”, that elections are “rigged” against him, while spinning false conspiracy theories as camouflage, so that none of them seem real, or all of them do. As Arendt observed, in an unstable, incomprehensible world, people arrive at the point “where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true”.</p> <p>Conspiracy theories are the authoritarian answer to paranoia; everything is equally possible, but an authority remains in control. This makes conspiracy more comforting than contingency, especially if you find authority reassuring. Conspiracy and paranoia insist there is always a plot, and every plot has an author: someone is always in charge, even if it’s a person you don’t like. Especially if it’s a person you don’t like, because then you have someone to blame.</p> <p>Paranoid narratives are inherently narcissistic as well as authoritarian. Paranoia rejects the proportionality of pluralism, in which the world’s indifference to you is a sign of its multiplicity, and interprets that indifference as malice. The world is not unmoved by your existence, but upholds your central importance: even your refrigerator is spying on you. A paranoid system confirms that your powerlessness is only because the game is rigged against you– and that the world cares enough to bother disempowering you.</p>    <p>Some of the “religious traditions” Hofstadter identified feed into this paranoia. Orwell detected a strong family resemblance between totalitarianism and theocracy: “A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible.” Paintings of Trump in the hands of Jesus that circulated during his presidency struck non-believers as absurd, not least because of the profanely immoral life he leads, but were admired in all seriousness by the devout. Mike Pence is hailed by rightwing Christian leaders as the “model” of an “evangelical politician”, a label that controverts the constitution’s establishing separation of church and state. Trump’s attorney general <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/william-barr"">William Barr</a> is a crusading religious zealot, avowing the centrality of Christian nationalism to American life. He has said the “moral order” of the United States can only be based on “a transcendent Supreme Being”, a belief that leads naturally to an authoritarian politics.</p> <p>Trump has spent four years exerting political power to make reality conform to his every assertion. This is both a theocratic performance, and a totalitarian one. The more deranged the assertion, the better it served his purpose: the statements had to be wildly detached from reality, so as to make clear his power to bend reality toward his word. Godlike Trump pronounced, and people scrambled to make it real – or to appear real. That was the essence of “Sharpiegate”, for example, when a weather map did not conform to Trump’s description of Hurricane Dorian’s path. Having crudely altered the map with a Sharpie pen, Trump insisted that official records be altered to conform to his claims. As philosophers of language have pointed out, the crudity was not an error, it was the point. Trump was not aiming to deceive, he was performing divine fiat: make it so. This is precisely the process of “rectifying” official records that Orwell describes in <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four; </em>in “The Prevention of Literature” two years earlier he’d noted that “totalitarianism demands, in fact, the continuous alteration of the past”.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--inline""> <blockquote> <p>American culture fetishises the truth for a reason ... our history is riddled with lies: that we talk about truth so much is just a tell</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Elias Canetti, paranoid and totalitarian systems created conspiratorial fictions reflecting “a disease of power”, a narcissistic, compulsive need to destroy the world as proof of that power: “To be the last man to remain alive is the deepest urge of every seeker after power … Once he feels himself threatened his passionate desire to see <em>everyone </em>lying dead before him can scarcely be mastered by his reason.” “Mastery” here is critical: the strongman has to perform his strength not merely over his opponents, but over language and narrative, so that he can alter reality at will.</p> <p>Canetti was writing about a German judge named Daniel Schreber, who became Freud’s most famous case study for paranoia. In his 1997 study of Schreber, <em>My Own Private Germany, </em>Eric Santner argued that paranoia derives from a symbolic crisis in authority, and described the ways in which Schreber’s paranoia seemed to anticipate the paranoid culture of Nazi Germany. “Where there is a culture of paranoia,” Santner concluded, “fascism of one kind or another may not be far behind.”</p> <p>•••</p> <p>Over the last four years, many have acknowledged, however reluctantly, the ways in which Trump’s presidency is symptomatic of entrenched maladies in the American body politic: his divisiveness, rage, dishonesty, greed, double-dealing, dishonour, puerility, truculence, fragility, narcissism and paranoia, all characterise American society today. Trump’s exceptionalism is also American: the rules apply to everyone but him. Trump is all of America’s worst qualities, the nation’s id come to roaring life.</p> <p>If Trump is symptomatic of America’s diseases of power, then his compulsive dishonesty might be the most revealing pathology of all. The US is a chronically untruthful country, deceit written into its very framework. The constitution contains explicit protections of slavery but never uses the word “slavery”, a deeply mendacious deception that eventually became a collective self-deception. The declaration “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal” was written by a man who enslaved men he did not consider his equal, and became the foundation of a country that incessantly declared its belief in truth and justice while enslaving and oppressing much of its population.</p> <p>Like many Americans, I have spent four years struggling against a pathological liar in the White House, only to realise, belatedly, that American culture fetishises the truth for a reason. “We hold these truths”, “truth, justice, and the American way”, the fable of the boy George Washington insisting he cannot tell a lie, “Honest Abe” Lincoln: this is a society protesting too much. American history is riddled with lies: that we talk about truth so much is just a tell.</p> <p>After the civil war freed the slaves, the white south immediately passed laws to disenfranchise black Americans, and then wrote stories – historical fiction and “histories” that were fiction – to justify its betrayals of the laws it had ostensibly passed. That fiction even had a title – “The Lost Cause” – which it acquired from the novels of Sir Walter Scott. The Lost Cause was perhaps the most powerful conspiracy theory of all, spinning a consoling, coherent romance out of a brutally incoherent historical reality. The Lost Cause was designed to offer a way for the white south to save face after its humiliating defeat, maintaining that the north was to blame for the civil war, which wasn’t really fought to defend slavery. This self-serving myth has had profound consequences, deepening the divisions over which the war was fought, rather than healing them.</p>    <p>Now the US appears set to repeat exactly the same mistake, enabling Trump voters – and Trump himself – to create a fiction claiming they didn’t actually lose the 2020 election. “The legal operation is designed for Trump to save face,” a White House source reportedly said: “It’s meant to give him an avenue to leave in the best possible way.”</p> <p>It has often been said that America had to imagine itself into existence; less often remarked is the corollary, that America is, in a very real sense, merely a story the nation tells itself. That makes the US singularly subject to the meanings of words, to the fetishised language of the founding documents. But now it is a country arguing that a constitutional amendment beginning with the words “well-regulated” prohibits regulation, one whose supreme court ruled that a corporation is the same as an individual. This is Humpty Dumpty through the looking glass, proclaiming that words mean whatever he says they mean. “The question,” as Humpty tells Alice, is “which is to be master – that’s all.”</p> <p>When we lose track of whose version of a story to trust, paranoia ensues. It seems no coincidence that we find ourselves in an epistemological crisis several years into what is frequently described as a “crisis in the humanities”, the very subjects that devote themselves to epistemological systems: language, literature, history, philosophy. The destruction of epistemological foundations creates the crisis in knowledge.</p> <p>For Arendt, imagination is where politics lives: the capacity to imagine ourselves as other than we are is the predicate both for lying and for political action. Democracy is the politics of the possible, rather than of the inevitable or coercive. Political and cultural rhetoric creates the conditions for its own realisation: thus we can only save ourselves if we tell the truth. Democracy relies on foundations of shared truths, because the social contract depends on mutual trust. “This is not who we are,” Joe Biden repeated throughout his campaign. To a certain extent we are what we do, not who we say we are (“action is character,” as F Scott Fitzgerald once observed). But performative language complicates that distinction. In insisting “This is not who we are”, Biden also creates the conditions to change who we are, to become who we say we wish to be.</p>"

I mean, he said he did and I believe him … But if the artist who made it is saying you never spoke to them, if that means something to you, you probably will stop playing it. And it meant something to Donald and he stopped.”</p> <p>Trump himself said “Rockin’ in the Free World was just one of 10 songs used as background music. Didn’t love it anyway.” But he started to use the song again in his 2020 re-election campaign, by which time Young had become a frequently outspoken opponent of the president.</p> <p>Ahead of his August lawsuit, Young said he was considering bringing it after seeing the deployment of what he described as “trooper thugs” to tackle protesters in Portland. He also criticised Trump in June, after he played Rockin’ in the Free World and Like a Hurricane at a Mount Rushmore speech.</p> <p>Trump still faces a lawsuit from musician Eddy Grant, who opposed the use of his song Electric Avenue in a campaign video, and said it was used without a licence. Trump’s legal team have argued they were allowed to use it under a “fair use” clause.</p>"

Furthermore, Trump’s stoking of division in his own party has even succeeded in uniting warring factions among his opponents.</p> <p>Responding on Wednesday night to the president’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/22/covid-relief-trump-demands-changes-to-sign-900bn-bill"">bombshell threat</a> to veto the $900bn Covid relief and stimulus bill, Democratic leaders and members of the progressive House “Squad” – otherwise at each other’s throats – welcomed Trump’s demand for increased direct payments to individual Americans.</p> <p>“Let’s do it!” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p> <p>“We can pass $2k checks this week,” wrote Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p> <p>Somewhere on Capitol Hill, presumably, Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell buried his head in his hands.</p> <h2>‘Send me a suitable bill, or else’</h2> <p>Predictions that Trump will wreck and split the Republican party have been rife since 2015, when he wrecked and split – and won – the race for the presidential nomination. While the party remains whole, and an official split will be a surprise, it has now descended into internecine strife, Trump loyalists fighting for the lost cause of a second term while others seek to adjust to life back in opposition.</p> <p>Trump maintains a strong hold on the hard-right Republican base, on a large part of the House delegation who owe their seats to that base and on influential senators. The penalty for apostasy is clear: a primary from the right or, as rumour has it in the case of the Florida senator Marco Rubio, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/13/ivanka-trump-speculation-potential-run-us-senate-florida"">a challenge from Trump’s own daughter</a>.</p> <p>But in contrast to the zeal of the Maga-fuelled legions, in the Senate the party establishment has now rejected Trump’s increasingly wild attempts to hold on to power while negotiating the Covid deal which stoked Tuesday night’s extraordinary display of presidential petulance <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/22/covid-relief-trump-demands-changes-to-sign-900bn-bill"">from the White House podium</a>.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/22/covid-relief-trump-demands-changes-to-sign-900bn-bill"">In his video message</a>, Trump bemoaned spending commitments in the relief deal and demanded Congress “send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a Covid relief package. And maybe that administration will be me.”</p> <p>It won’t, even if Trump’s allies in the House and Senate go through with <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/22/trump-election-result-overturning-effort-republicans"">planned challenges to the electoral college result</a> in Congress on 6 January. Democrats who control the House will ensure the result is certified there, while <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/22/trump-election-result-overturning-effort-republicans"">McConnell and his deputies</a> assure passage in the Senate.</p> <p>But if such challenges can only be performative, they will be politically beneficial for everyone except the Republican establishment which will help to beat them down. Trump’s refusal to accept defeat, not to mention the vicious fire he and his allies have directed at McConnell since the senator recognised Joe Biden’s win, is damaging the president’s own party.</p> <p>A day before the electoral college result is certified, two run-off elections in Georgia will decide control of the Senate. Early voting has started. Seeking to hold on to the party’s best hope of thwarting Biden’s agenda, McConnell needs a united front. Such is Trump’s refusal to accept party discipline or political reality, that has become impossible.</p> <p>Georgia’s two sitting senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, have thrown in their lots with Trump. That means supporting his claim the presidential election was rigged, which <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/30/republicans-trump-georgia-fraud-claims-441551"">the party establishment fears</a> could suppress Republican turnout.</p> <h2>‘A different course’</h2> <p>On CNN last weekend, the Utah senator and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a frequent Trump critic, was asked if he “still recognised the Republican party”.</p> <p>“The party has taken a different course than obviously the one that I knew as a younger person,” Romney said, adding that his Republican party stood for leading abroad while “balancing the budget” at home.</p> <p>“And we believed that character was essential in the leaders that we chose. We’ve strayed from that. I don’t see us returning to that for a long time.”</p> <p>The remark about character was pointed. Romney went on to describe a battle to succeed Trump at the top of the party that promises to be as life was to Thomas Hobbes: nasty and brutish, if long-term rather than short.</p> <p>“As I look at the 2024 contenders,” Romney said, “most of them are trying to become as much like Donald Trump as they can be. Although I must admit that his style and schtick, if you will, is difficult to duplicate.”</p> <p>Of necessity, ambitious senators such as Josh Hawley of Missouri, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas would have taken that as a compliment – but also a warning. Trump is reportedly likely to announce his own candidacy for 2024 not long after removal from office.</p> <p>“I represent a very small slice of the Republican party today,” Romney continued, “but you know everybody has to stand up for what they believe. And I believe my colleagues are doing what they think is right.”</p> <p>For some Republicans, Trump has already proven too much.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote element--supporting""> <blockquote> <p>The party remains in one piece.

The Democratic party and the Pro-Democracy Republican party should put their heads together and devise a strategy to bring that about – quickly, and certainly before 2024.”</p> <p>Romney has disappointed Democrats before, not least over the appointment of supreme court justice Amy Coney Barrett. But he seems to be up for the fight.</p> <p>“I think I’m more effective in the Republican party, continuing to battle for the things I believe in,” he said, when asked if he would leave. “I think ultimately the Republican party will return to the roots that have been formed over the last century.</p> <p>“Hopefully people will recognise we need to take a different course than the one we’re on right now.”</p>"

<p>Donald Trump’s handling of the Covid crisis is a serious weak point with voters, <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/"">polls suggest</a>, so it is little surprise he continues to downplay the resurgence. The president has said repeatedly in recent days the US has “turned a corner” on the virus, and used his own apparent Covid recovery to frame the disease as entirely surmountable. He struck an often upbeat tone at his rallies over the weekend, where social distancing protocols were largely ignored and crowds often seen without masks.

<h2>Around the web</h2>

australia-news/2020/oct/06/us-election-briefing-for-australia-trump-tries-to-bodyslam-covid,US election briefing for Australia: Trump claims victory over Covid,2020-10-06T06:31:18Z,"<p>Welcome to today’s US election briefing for Australia.</p> 
<p>“Don’t let it dominate you.” Only four days after being diagnosed with Covid, president Donald Trump emerged from hospital on Monday, casting himself as a victor over a virus that continues to ravage his country.</p> 
<p>The president stepped off his helicopter Marine One, ascended the stairs of the White House and triumphantly ripped off his mask on the balcony in a carefully choreographed display. A long-time fan of <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wwe-fan-donald-trump-has-never-tapped-out-pro-wrestling-n693611"">professional wrestling</a> and <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-02-21/president-trump-favorite-movies-parasite-oscar"">action movies</a>, Trump and his team have quickly absorbed the president’s ongoing illness into his broader political narrative as a strongman uniquely positioned to lead America.</p> 
<p>Standing on the balcony, he told Americans not to be afraid. His press secretary, the latest aide to be diagnosed with the coronavirus, praised him for <a href=""https://twitter.com/kayleighmcenany/status/1313254221660160000?s=20"">standing “strongly”</a>, while a Republican senator framed his return as a sign he had “<a href=""https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn/status/1313273763568455687?s=20"">once again defeated China</a>”. On Monday, the clear message was: Trump has bodyslammed this virus.</p> 
<p>But beyond the theatrics, reality beckons. Trump’s personal physician said that while the president’s condition “continued to improve”, he “may not be entirely out of the woods yet”. His heavy breathing was evident in <a href=""https://twitter.com/girlsreallyrule/status/1313268303922634755?s=20"">news footage</a>. And Trump is likely still contagious, raising fears for the scores of staffers who work in the building, many of whom are people of colour and aged over 50, <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/trump-putting-white-house-staff-risk-covid-19/616617/"">according to the Atlantic</a>.</p> 
<p>Across from the White House the day before his return, <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/05/us/covid-national-remembrance-empty-chairs-trnd/index.html"">Covid survivors set up 20,000 empty chairs, a memorial to the virus’ American victims</a>. Each chair represented 10 people who have died so far; people who, in their president’s conception of the world, “let” themselves be “dominated” by Covid. It wasn’t clear whether they ran out of chairs or space first.</p> 
<h2>The big stories</h2> 
<p><strong>Trump was sharply rebuked by medical experts </strong>after<strong> </strong> telling Americans in a recorded message on Monday not to be “afraid of it” and that the US had “the best medicines”. Here’s <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/05/donald-trump-walter-reed-hospital-covid-19"">the full report on his return</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Joe Biden countered Trump’s message on Monday, saying wearing a mask is a “patriotic duty”.</strong> The candidate addressed Trump’s diagnosis and other issues <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/06/joe-biden-masks-matter-trump-florida-town-hall"">at an event in Florida</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Trump’s top spokesperson, Kayleigh McEnany, is the latest high-profile member of the president’s inner circle to test positive for coronavirus</strong>. McEnany has conducted in-person press briefings in recent days, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/05/white-house-trump-coronavirus-covid-kayleigh-mcenany"">including one on Sunday where she removed her mask</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Trump said in March he “didn’t have a lot of time” to meet the top public health expert Dr Anthony Fauci for a briefing about the coronavirus outbreak</strong> that was then gathering pace, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/05/trump-fauci-coronavirus-bob-woodward-book"">according to a new recording</a> released by reporter Bob Woodward.</p> 
<p><strong>Democrats are concerned an increasingly desperate Trump is aiming to win re-election not at the ballot box but through voter intimidation, courts and counting rooms. </strong><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/05/trump-election-poll-watchers-voter-intimidation-tactics"">Here’s the latest</a> on what both parties are doing regarding poll watching.</p> 
<h2>Quote of the day</h2> 
<blockquote class=""quoted""> 
 <p>Thank you Miranda</p> 
 <p>Donald Trump gives Australian News Corp columnist Miranda Devine <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1313266826718187521?s=20"">a shout out</a> on Twitter after she wrote he would be “an invincible hero” if he bounces back to the campaign trail.</p>

<h2>Election views</h2> 
<p><strong>“No one really thought that Trump would emerge chastened from his brush with the virus,” writes Julian Borger, </strong>“but not only was [Trump] unrepentant about the White House’s cavalier approach to masks and social distancing, he has reinforced it”. With his behaviour over the past 24 hours, the president has produced “a toxic workplace to the point of potential lethality”.</p> 
<p><strong>“Donald the Super-Spreader is an insult to those Americans who have altered their own lives beyond recognition in order to fight the coronavirus,”</strong> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/05/trump-republicans-coronavirus-super-spreader-risk"">writes Moira Donegan</a>. Watching the videos of the rose garden ceremony, where Republicans gathered in close proximity, hugged and shook hands, she couldn’t help but think of the funerals she has attended over the past year over Zoom.</p> 
<p><strong>“What happens to the appeal of the strongman politician when he ends up in hospital?”</strong> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/05/covid-boris-johnson-donald-trump-strongman-politicians"">asks Zoe Williams</a>. To understand what might be in store for Trump, Williams looks at the effects of the virus on Boris Johnson, whose ability to project certainty has faltered.</p> 
<h2>Video of the day</h2> 
<p>Guardian reporter Kenya Evelyn travels to Florida, where the Democrats’ most loyal bloc, Black women, are also bearing the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak, with its impact accelerating the fight for voting rights. From mail-in ballots and early voting to felon disenfranchisement, Black voters are wielding their power to demand more from Democrats ahead of November.</p>

<h2>Around the web</h2> 
<p>There is a schism in the Trump family over the president’s behaviour, <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/don-jr-thinks-trump-is-acting-crazy-presidents-covid-joyride-has-family-divided"">according to a report in </a><strong><a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/don-jr-thinks-trump-is-acting-crazy-presidents-covid-joyride-has-family-divided"">Vanity Fair</a></strong>, with Donald Trump Jnr reportedly deeply concerned about his dad’s behaviour in recent days. The eldest son wants an intervention, but Ivanka and husband Jared Kushner keep telling the president “how great he is doing”.</p> 
<p>There will be a plexiglass barrier between vice-president Mike Pence and his Democrat opponent Kamala Harris, the <strong>Washington Post</strong> reports, when they meet for their debate on Wednesday. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pence-harris-debate-plexiglass-barriers/2020/10/05/7d779bb2-074b-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html"">Experts told the paper</a> the VP really should be in quarantine, though, due to his potential exposure to the virus.</p>
